Asymptotic Analysis of Future Value Prediction

1. Recursive Approach (Without Memoization)

Time Complexity:

  Best Case:  Ω(1) – When `n = 0`
  Average Case: Θ(n) – Linear recursion from `n` down to 0
  Worst Case: O(n) – Maximum depth `n` when computing `FV(n)`

Space Complexity:  Θ(n) – Due to recursion call stack

---

2. Recursive Approach (With Memoization)

Time Complexity:

Best Case:  Ω(1) – When result for `n` is already cached
Average Case:Θ(n) – Each subproblem is solved once
Worst Case:  O(n) – All values from 0 to `n` are computed and stored

Space Complexity:  Θ(n) – For memoization map + call stack

---

3. Iterative Approach

Time Complexity:**

  Best Case:  Ω(n) – Must loop through all `n` years
  Average Case: Θ(n)– Constant-time operations in a loop
  Worst Case:O(n) – Loop runs from 1 to `n`

Space Complexity:  Θ(1) – No recursion or extra storage needed
