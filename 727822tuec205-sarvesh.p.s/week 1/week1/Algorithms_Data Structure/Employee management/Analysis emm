Time Complexity
Add – O(1): Fast if space is available.
Search – O(n): Checks each employee one by one.
Traverse – O(n): Goes through all employees.
Delete – O(n): Finds and shifts elements after the deleted one.


 Limitations of Arrays

 Fixed size: You can't add more employees than the array's limit.
 Slow delete: Deleting means shifting other elements.
 Wasted space: Empty slots still take memory.
 Hard to insert in the middle: Elements need to be shifted.


When to Use Arrays

 You know how many employees you’ll manage.
 You mostly add and read data, not delete or insert in the middle.
 You want fast access using index numbers.
